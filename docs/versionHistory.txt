After adding features or stats to the website, make sure you update the version
history. First, update the current version number:

json/version.json
{
    "currentVersion": [
        0,
        3, // Minor version number
        2  // Patch number
    ],
    "versionHistory": {
        ...
    }
}

For most cases, you'll only be incrementing the patch number. Then, in
"versionHistory", scroll all the way to the bottom to add another entry in the
set of nested objects:

json
"2": {
    "date": "2024/01/12", // YYYY/MM/DD
    "content": [
        "Added Battles 2 6.4 stats",
        "000 Beast Handler does 2 damage instead of 1 (emilplane)"
    ]
},

Add any notes as to what was changed in the "content" array. Some guidelines:
- Refer to a tower with the full name: Dart Monkey rather than Dart
- Refer to an upgrade with the tower name and path rather than the upgrade name:
  3xx Dart Monkey rather than Spike-O-Pult
  - If you are referring to an upgrade, say 3xx, not 300
  - If you are referring to an upgrade with a crosspath, say 302
  - If you are referring to a specific upgrade with its future upgrades, say 
  3+xx (refers to 3xx, 4xx, and 5xx) or 301+ (refers to 301 and 302)
- Attribute a person who contributed a change by their full Discord username
  (not display name) at the end. For example, "000 Beast Handler does 2 damage
  instead of 1 (emilplane)"

Note: updating news, etc. does not warrant a patch update; instead, just add the
content without changing any version history info
