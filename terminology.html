                        <h4>Damage (d)</h4>
                        <p>Damage is the amount of layers or health removed from a bloon.</p>
                        <p>Some attacks do extra damage to certain types of bloons:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>MOAB-class damage (md)</li>
                            <li>Fortified damage (fd)</li>
                            <li>Fortified MOAB-class damage (fmd)*</li>
                            <li>Ceramic damage (cd)</li>
                            <li>Lead damage (ld)</li>
                            <li>Camo damage (cad)</li>
                            <li>Frozen damage (frd)</li>
                            <li>Stunned bloon damage (sd)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>*This is only used for attacks that do extra damage to fortified 
                            MOAB-class bloons, but not regular MOAB-class bloons or regular 
                            fortified bloons. Similarly, if an attack does extra damage to 
                            all MOAB-class bloons and extra damage to all fortified bloons, 
                            then the md and fd properties are used.</p>

                        <p>If available, the spread of the projectiles are indicated. For example, 4j 60Â° spread means 4 projectiles  that are spread out over 60 degrees.</p>

                        <p>Sometimes, pierce is replaced with impact (i). This is the same as pierce, except for that it can't be pierce buffed.</p>

                        <p>If "blast" or "zone" is indicated afterwards, the attack affects bloons immediately instead of throwing a projectile (for example, 4xx Monkey Sub's radioactive attack)</p>

                        <p>The time between attacks in seconds. This is commonly confused 
                            with attack speed, which refers to attacks per second. For 
                            example, if a tower shoots a projectile every quarter second, then 
                            it has 4 attack speed, but 0.25 attack cooldown, which is what is 
                            used here.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>0.95s means the time between each attack is 0.95 seconds</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Attack cooldown buffs (i.e. 75%s) decrease the time between attacks</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>75%s on a 1s attack would become 0.75s, because 75% of 1s is 0.75s</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>If "passive" is indicated afterwards, the tower always attacks, as
                            opposed to the default behavior, where a tower only attacks
                            if there is a tower in range.</p>

                            different bloons that the attack can pop.</p>

                        <h4>Upgrades and buffs</h4>
                        <p>
                            When applying many stat buffs from both upgrades and external towers, it is important to 
                            apply them in the correct order. The algorithm is as follows:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Stat buffs from tower upgrades always apply before buffs from external towers.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        First, multiplicative buffs are applied. For example, if a tower 
                                        has 2 pierce and has an upgrade that gives it 3x pierce ("300%p"), then it now has 6 pierce.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Next, percentage buffs added together and applied as a multiplier. For example,
                                        if we have:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>one upgrade that gives +50%p, and </li>
                                            <li>one upgrade that gives +200%p,</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        then both stats are first added together (+250%p) and then multiplied. For our 
                                        previous example, 6*2.5 = 15 pierce.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Finally, additive buffs are added together. For example, a +20p buff
                                        will result in 15+20 = 35 pierce.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                After all upgrades have been evaulated, external buffs are then applied using the above
                                process. Remember, these calculations use our previously calculated value.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                For example, if we have a buff that gives us 200%p, we multiply it by our 35p to get 70p.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
